# Welcome to MotoGP Data and Analytics like never before

> **What makes this repository special?**
>
> - 🏆 **First of its kind:** There has been a lack of any MotoGP data—let alone advanced statistics—about this great sport. This is the first open, structured, and regularly updated MotoGP data repository.
> - ⏱ **Timely updates:** Data will be updated one day after each race (exact timing still IN PROGRESS) in 2025 and every update will be transparently documented here on GitHub.
> - ✅ **Verified accuracy:** All data is verified against the official standings on [motogp.com](https://motogp.com) (IN PROGRESS).
> - 📦 **Open access:** Data is freely downloadable as CSV files, accessible via API to the MySQL database, or through an embedded, user-friendly Power BI report (IN PROGRESS).
> - 🤝 **Community-driven:** Users are invited to create their own analyses in any format (especially Jupyter Notebooks) and upload them here—let’s grow the MotoGP analytics community together (IN PROGRESS)!

This repository is the central hub for collecting, sharing, and analyzing MotoGP statistics—currently focused on the ongoing season, with plans to include all historical data. All results are persisted in a MySQL database and made available for community-driven analytics and reporting.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture: Medallion Approach

This project follows the Medallion Architecture, organizing data into three layers:

- **Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingested as-is from sources (currently: API -> CSVs -> MySQL).
- **Silver Layer:** Cleaned, standardized, and normalized data—ensuring quality and consistency.
- **Gold Layer:** Race-ready, analytical data—modeled and aggregated for reporting and advanced analytics.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **MotoGP Data Collection:** Scripts and notebooks fetch, parse, and verify MotoGP race data.
- **ETL Pipelines:** Data flows from Bronze to Silver to Gold layers, enabling robust analytics.
- **Data Modeling:** Clear schemas for riders, teams, races, results, and more.
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Example analysis, queries, and visualizations to analyze performance, trends, and history.
- **Community Analysis:** A dedicated place for everyone to contribute their own notebooks, visualizations, and findings.
