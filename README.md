# Welcome to MotoGP Data and Analytics like never before

> **What makes this repository special?**
>
> - 🏆 **First of its kind:** There has been a lack of any MotoGP data—let alone advanced statistics—about this great sport. This is the first open, structured, and regularly updated MotoGP data repository.
> - ⏱ **Timely updates:** Data will be updated one day after each race in 2025 and every update will be transparently documented here on GitHub.
> - ✅ **Verified accuracy:** All data is verified against the official standings on [motogp.com](https://motogp.com).
> - 📦 **Open access:** Data is freely downloadable as CSV files, accessible via API to the MySQL database, or through an embedded, user-friendly Power BI report.
> - 🤝 **Community-driven:** Users are invited to create their own analyses in any format (especially Jupyter Notebooks) and upload them here—let’s grow the MotoGP analytics community together!

Welcome to the **MotoGP Data Project**! 🏁  
This repository is the central hub for collecting, sharing, and analyzing MotoGP statistics—currently focused on the ongoing season, with plans to include all historical data. All results are persisted in a MySQL database and made available for community-driven analytics and reporting.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture: Medallion Approach

This project follows the Medallion Architecture, organizing data into three layers:

- **Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingested as-is from official sources (web scraping, APIs, CSVs).
- **Silver Layer:** Cleaned, standardized, and normalized data—ensuring quality and consistency.
- **Gold Layer:** Business-ready, analytical data—modeled and aggregated for reporting and advanced analytics.

> **MotoGP example:**  
> - Bronze: Raw race result tables as fetched  
> - Silver: Cleaned records with unified rider names and validated timestamps  
> - Gold: Aggregated tables for season standings, podiums per rider, team performance over time

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **MotoGP Data Collection:** Scripts and notebooks fetch, parse, and verify MotoGP race data.
- **ETL Pipelines:** Data flows from Bronze to Silver to Gold layers, enabling robust analytics.
- **Data Modeling:** Clear schemas for riders, teams, races, results, and more.
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Example Jupyter Notebooks, queries, and visualizations to analyze performance, trends, and history.
- **Community Analysis:** A dedicated place for everyone to contribute their own notebooks, visualizations, and findings.

## ⚙️ Data Rules & Principles

- **Source Transparency:** All data comes from official MotoGP sources and is verified against [motogp.com](https://motogp.com).
- **Update Policy:** Data is updated one day after each race (2025 season) and every update is documented on GitHub.
- **Open Access:** Download data as CSV, access via API, or explore in Power BI.
- **Community Focus:** Contribute your own analyses—Jupyter Notebooks, dashboards, scripts, or visualizations are welcome!
- **Documentation:** All ETL steps, schemas, and transformation logic are documented for transparency.
